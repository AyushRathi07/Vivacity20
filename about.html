            <p>Vivacity, in its existence, stood justifying itself as one of the liveliest and most animated jubilations
                that youth has ever experienced. Embarked upon in 2007, this Cultural-Management festival today has
                snowballed to the popularity of gigantic proportions; all of which can be attributed to the acuminous
                student committee that has piloted this fest in its odyssey so far. It is a juxtaposition of several
                contentions of dance, music, dramatics, literature, and fashion, with sundry informal fun events,
                authorized workshops, exhibitions and gaming challenges. The brimming talents who are judged by
                distinguished virtuoso vie their way to win titanic prizes. We, the Vivacity team, yet again have come
                up with the proud invitation to this joie de vivre. Come, be a part of this artistic masterpiece, come
                be a part of Vivacity 2020!</p>
